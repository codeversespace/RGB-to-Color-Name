**Color Name Finder**
**Purpose**:
This Python script determines the closest color name from a given RGB value based on a provided JSON color database.

**Dependencies**:
json
webcolors

**Usage**:
Create a JSON file named colors.json:

This file should contain a list of color names and their corresponding hexadecimal values in the following format:
JSON
[
    {"name": "red", "hex": "#FF0000"},
    {"name": "green", "hex": "#008000"},
    ...
]

Run the Python script:

The script will read the colors.json file and calculate the closest color name for a given RGB value.
The output will be printed to the console.
**Example**:

**rgb = (174, 100, 127)
closest_colorname = get_colour_name(rgb)
print(f'the closest color for RGB value {rgb} is {closest_colorname}')**

**Explanation**:

The script imports the json and webcolors libraries.
The get_colour_name function takes an RGB tuple as input.
It loads the color data from the colors.json file.
For each color in the database, it calculates the Euclidean distance between the input RGB value and the color's RGB value.
The color with the smallest distance is returned as the closest color.
Limitations:

The accuracy of the color matching depends on the color database and the chosen color distance metric.
The script might be slow for large color databases.
Improvements:

Consider using a more efficient color distance metric.
Optimize the code for performance.
Expand the color database for better accuracy.
Additional Notes:

The webcolors library can be installed using pip install webcolors.
The script assumes that the colors.json file is in the same directory as the Python script.
By following these guidelines, you can effectively use and improve this color name finder script.
